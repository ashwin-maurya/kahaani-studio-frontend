              <span className="first-character sc">I</span>n 1978, Brian Smith
              landed in Southern California with a bag of sheepskin boots and
              hope. He fell in love with the sheepskin experience and was
              convinced the world would one day share this love. The beaches of
              Southern California had long been an epicenter of a relaxed,
              casual lifestyle, a lifestyle that Brian felt was a perfect fit
              for his brand. So he founded the UGG brand, began selling his
              sheepskin boots and they were an immediate sensation. By the mid
              1980's, the UGG brand became a symbol of relaxed southern
              California culture, gaining momentum through surf shops and other
              shops up and down the coast of California, from San Diego to Santa
              Cruz. UGG boots reached beyond the beach, popping up in big cities
              and small towns all over, and in every level of society. Girls
              wore their surfer boyfriend's pair of UGG boots like a letterman
              jacket. When winter came along, UGG boots were in ski shops and
              were seen in lodges from Mammoth to Aspen.

              <span className="first-character ny">B</span>reaking into the New
              York fashion world is no easy task. But by the early 2000's, UGG
              Australia began to take it by storm. The evolution of UGG from a
              brand that made sheepskin boots, slippers, clogs and sandals for
              an active, outdoor lifestyle to a brand that was now being touted
              as a symbol of a stylish, casual and luxurious lifestyle was
              swift. Much of this was due to a brand repositioning effort that
              transformed UGG into a high-end luxury footwear maker. As a
              fashion brand, UGG advertisements now graced the pages of Vogue
              Magazine as well as other fashion books. In the mid 2000's, the
              desire for premium casual fashion was popping up all over the
              world and UGG was now perfectly aligned with this movement.

              fashion community notices your brand, the world soon follows. The
              widespread love for UGG extended to Europe in the mid-2000's along
              with the stylish casual movement and demand for premium casual
              fashion. UGG boots and shoes were now seen walking the streets of
              London, Paris and Amsterdam with regularity. To meet the rising
              demand from new fans, UGG opened flagship stores in the UK and an
              additional location in Moscow. As the love spread farther East,
              concept stores were opened in Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo. UGG
              Australia is now an international brand that is loved by all. This
              love is a result of a magical combination of the amazing
              functional benefits of sheepskin and the heightened emotional
              feeling you get when you slip them on your feet. In short, you
              just feel better all over when you wear UGG boots, slippers, and
              shoes.
